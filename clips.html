      <h3>8 Crazy End of the World Theories</h3>
      <p>Today marks the one-month countdown to the end of the world, at least if you believe in the Mayan calendar, Hollywood, and what you read online.</p>
<p>Dec. 21, 2012 is the last day of the Mayan calendar, when an ancient civilization possibly predicted the world would end, perhaps with solar storms and catastrophic tidal effects. Or maybe the Earth’s axis will suddenly shift. And if that doesn’t happen, there is still planet Niburu, roughly four times the size of the Earth, and headed straight for us. <a href="http://www.moneytalksnews.com/2012/11/22/8-crazy-end-of-the-world-theories/" target="new">Continued...</a></p></div>

      <h3>The Brew-haha</h3>
<p>If recent numbers are predicting future times, we’re in the midst of a beer boom. According to a recent Nielsen study, last year, beer sales increased by 5 million cases between the end of February and the beginning of September. But in the same period of 2011, sales had decreased by 1.7 million cases.</p>
<p>Jeff Slankard, the Wine and Beer Director for Barons Market says, “Taste, variety and packaging all drive consumer’s choices.” And they’re certainly driving sales. Craft brews hit the market in a big way, adding new tastes and more variety to the beer industry. In the summer of 2012, 582 new beer brands launched in the market, according to Nielsen, like Stone Brewing Company’s Pillow Mint at the Ritz or Rouge’s Voodoo Doughnut Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Ale. And craft breweries aren’t the only ones hoping to tempt consumer’s taste buds; domestic brewers are turning to unusual flavors and adding variety to their lineup. Bud Light Lime anyone? <a href="http://www.mainstreet.com/slideshow/smart-spending/5-ways-save-money-beer-boom" target="new">Continued...</a></p></div>

      <h3>Using Social Networking to Land a Job?<br />
        4 Things Not to Do</h3>
<p>According to a study by Jobvite, a recruiting software company, 86 percent of job seekers had a social networking profile in 2011. But only 16 percent of them have used social networking to look for a new job.</p>
<p>That 16 percent have the right idea. Using social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn can help find work – if it’s done right. But done wrong, your social profiles can actually sabotage your networking attempts.

      <h3>Why Gen Y is Losing the Debt Battle</h3>
      <p>Generation Y - those born between 1981 and 1995 - carry less debt than the national average. But it isn’t necessarily a good thing. Most of Gen Y’s members hold “bad debts” – like credit card debt and other loan products that don’t build assets. No one can conclusively answer why. Maybe it’s the job market. Maybe impulse buying and a digitalized consumer-driven society are to blame. Whatever it is, experts are wary those debt woes aren’t going to get better anytime soon. </p><a href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/moneyinvesting/credit/debt/why-gen-y-losing-debt-battle" target="new">Continued...</a></div>

      <h3>7 Tips For Hitting The Farmer's Market Like A Pro This Summer</h3>
      <p>The way many Americans buy their food is changing.
According to a study by the market research group Mintel, more people are choosing locally grown produce over fruits and vegetables that are labeled “organic.”
Between 2008 and 2011, organic (also called “natural”) fruit sales declined 58 percent.
Vegetables with a natural or organic seal declined 77 percent.
One reason could be the big price tag for these products, combined with the recession.
It’s not secret organically grown food typically costs more. As Fox News detailed a few weeks ago, it requires more labor and costlier fertilizer, among other things.
So what are healthy but cost-conscious consumers to do? Well, 52 percent of the people surveyed by Mintel have decided it’s more important to buy locally grown foods than organics.</p>

      <h3>Eight Surprising Ways to Raise Your<br />
        Credit Score</h3>
      <p>In 2011, 62.3 percent of people had a credit score between 749 and 300, according to the MyFICO blog, managed by the Fair Isaac Corporation. Most people in that range fell between 650-699 (12.1 percent) and 700-749 (15.5 percent).</p>
      <p>Those are decent credit scores. Within that range, you would get approved for most credit products with acceptable interest rates. I should know. I bounced around between 650 and 749 for most of my adult life – until I decided to boost my OK credit score into greatness two years ago. Today, I fall into the 800-850 range, shared by 18.3 percent of the U.S. consumer population last year. With that credit score, I get the best offers and the best rates on almost everything.</p>

      <h3>How To Save Money On Eating Out</h3>
      <p>How much do you spend on dining out? According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average American family forked over $2,505 on meals away from home in 2010. While that number is down from 2008, when it was $2,698, that’s still a lot of bread.</p>
      <p>If you cut your dining costs by just 30 percent, you’d be $751.50 richer within a year. So how do you accomplish that? The obvious solution is: Just don’t go out to eat. But where’s the fun in that? For me, that’s impossible – partly because I live in New Orleans, where we have more than 1,200 restaurants, according to the New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau. Dining out is a way of life for me, but so is saving money and increasing my wealth. Here’s how I do both…</p>

      <p>To add insult to injury, you could be throwing money out the window if your home isn’t energy-efficient. Leaking windows, poorly insulated water heaters, and clogged air filters are all budget busters.</p>
